# Overview of the game

The main objective of the game is to race against a bot, with each bot offering a **different difficulty level**. There are three levels: easy, medium, and hard. The **higher the difficulty selected, the greater the bot’s chances of successfully overcoming obstacles**.

The player have the possibility to **choose between two different cars**, the red car or the white car.

The game has a **strategic phase** where the **player can place targets that can act as power-ups or obstacles**, **depending on the direction they are placed on the track and on which side of the track they are positioned**. The player also needs to take into consideration the **obstacles previously placed by the bot**, which are positioned **differently each time** the game is played.

The game is composed by the following 6 scenes:

- StartMenu
- ChooseDifficulty
- SelectCar
- TrackPlanning
- Race
- FinalMenu

# InitialMenu

When the game starts, it displays a button, the Start button. If the player selects Start button, the game proceeds to the next scene, the DifficultyMenu.

# SelectCar

At this stage, the smartphone camera activates, allowing the player to **choose their car**. There are two options available: **a red car and a white car**. The player must point the camera at the correct **target marker** so the game can recognize it.

Once the target is successfully detected, a confirmation message appears, asking whether the player is sure about their chosen car. By selecting Confirm, the player proceeds to the next scene, the TrackPlanning.

# TrackPlanning

During this phase, the player must first aim at the **track marker to reveal it**. After that, they can place **obstacles or power-ups** strategically by **positioning their markers near the track target**. The game displays the objects in real time while the player moves them.

Once the player is satisfied with the position, they simply click in "Place" to confirm the placement. **Up to three obstacles or power-ups** can be placed — with a maximum of one tire pile and two arrows. When the planning phase is complete, clicking "Save & Race" will take the player to the racing scene.

# Race

The cars follow a predefined path. To win the race, the player must avoid obstacles while strategically using power-ups.

### Avoiding Tire Stacks

To avoid tire stacks, the player must **jump** by quickly **moving the phone up and down**. If the jump is performed at the correct time, the car will successfully avoid the obstacle.

### Using the Shortcut Path

To take the shortcut, the player must **tilt the phone to the right** just before reaching the shortcut entrance. If done with the right timing, the car will follow a faster path, gaining advantage over the bot.

### Arrows (Power-ups or Hazards)

Red arrows may help or harm the racer depending on the direction they are crossed from. Crossing them from the **boost side increases the car’s speed** while crossing them from the **opposite side reduces the car’s speed**.

When the race finishes, the game move you for the FinalMenu.

# Assets

The assets used to produce the game were mainly taken from **Sketchfab**.

For the Augmented Reality part, **Vuforia** was the platform used to detect and track the image targets that anchor the virtual objects in the real world.

The targets were generated with chatGPT. There were generated **5 targets**.

All the **targets** necessary to play the game are in the **./Races/Assests/Images.**
